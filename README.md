# TestDomeCpp
Here are some TestDome C++ questions Ive found online together with some solutions.

You can find some of these here: https://www.testdome.com/tests/cpp-online-test/34

I wish to acknowledge and gratefully thank Arash Partow who has provided a comprehensive list of solutions here: http://www.partow.net/testdome/

I hope these might be of use to you. 

I am not convinced by the online test philosophy that TestDome promotes through its website. 
See, for example, https://blog.testdome.com/no-your-screening-process-is-not-that-great/

Regardless of my opinions, this medium article offers a thought provoking read into some of the issues behing Automated testing:
